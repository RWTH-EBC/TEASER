TEASER - Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit
==================================

The TEASER tool allows the creation of archetpye buidlings as well as the representation of existing buildings and the calculation 
of simulation parameters for lumped parameter simulation models. It is being developed at the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and
Indoor Climate (EBC) at RWTH Aachen University.

If you have any questions regarding TEASER feel free to contact us at teaser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de.

This software is work-in-progress. Documentation will be incomplete or missing and the software may not run properly.
