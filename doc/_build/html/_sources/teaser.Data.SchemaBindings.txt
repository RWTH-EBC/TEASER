schemabindings
===================

For the use of xml files we are using XML binding and PyXB. The automatic
generated code of the Python bindings and in addition all schema files (xsd)
can be found in this package

The opengis holds adjusted CityGML bindings for TEASER. Another option is to use
to generate these files for your Python installation using PyXB.
