TEASER4 - Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit
==================================

The TEASER4 tool allows the creation of archetpye buidlings as well as the representation of existing buildings and the calculation 
of simulation parameters for lumped parameter simulation models. It is being developed at the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and
Indoor Climate (EBC) at RWTH Aachen University.

If you have any questions regarding TEASER4 feel free to contact us at teaser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de.

This software is work-in-progress. Documentation will be incomplete or missing and the software may not run properly.

License
==================

TEASER4 is released by RWTH Aachen University's Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) under the

Acknowledgements
==================

Parts of TEASER4 have been developed within public funded projects and with financial support by BMWi (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy).

Description
==================
TEASER4 contains an archetype building generator as well as parameter calculation for the Low Order Model of the AixLib (https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib). TEASER4 is able to interface arbitrary data sources.

Version
==================

The current version is 0.1.2. As the idea of TEASER came up at the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) at RWTH Aachen University in 2012 and this is the fourth "internal" version, we leave the number 4 as a reminder.
