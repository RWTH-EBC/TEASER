```python
"""This module contains an example how to import TEASER projects from
`*.teaserjson` and pickle in order to reuse data.
"""

import teaser.logic.utilities as utilities
import os
```

In example e4_save we saved two TEASER projects using `*.teaserjson` and
Python package pickle. This example shows how to import these
information into your python environment again.

To load data from `*.teaserjson` we can use a simple API function. So
first we need to instantiate our API (similar to example
e1_generate_archetype). The json file is called
`ArchetypeExample.teaserjson` and saved in the default path. You need to
run e4 first before you can load this example file.

```python
from teaser.project import Project

prj = Project()

load_json = os.path.join(utilities.get_default_path(), "ArchetypeExample.json")

prj.load_project(path=load_json)

prj = Project()
prj.load_project(utilities.get_full_path("examples/examplefiles/unitTest.json"))
prj.save_project(file_name="unitTest", path=None)
```

To reload data from a pickle file, we do not need to instantiate an
API, as pickle will automatically instantiate all classes as they have
been saved. The saved file from example e4 is called ´teaser_pickle.p´

```python
import pickle

load_pickle = os.path.join(utilities.get_default_path(), "teaser_pickle.p")

pickle_prj = pickle.load(open(load_pickle, "rb"))
print(pickle_prj)
```

After you imported your teaser project one or another way into you
python environment you can access variables and functions.
