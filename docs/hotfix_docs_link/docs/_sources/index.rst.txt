TEASER (Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit) allows
fast generation of archetype buildings with low input requirements and the
export of individual dynamic simulation models for the below-mentioned Modelica
libraries. These libraries all use the framework of `Modelica IBPSA
library <https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica>`_. TEASER is being
developed at the `RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute
for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate <https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1>`_.

   - `AixLib <https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib>`_
   - `Buildings <https://github.com/lbl-srg/modelica-buildings>`_
   - `BuildingSystems <https://github.com/UdK-VPT/BuildingSystems>`_
   - `IDEAS <https://github.com/open-ideas/IDEAS>`_.

This software is work-in-progress. Documentation will be incomplete or missing
and the software may not run properly. In particular the Graphical User
Interface is a beta release and not fully tested. If you find any bugs, please
report them in the issue section of the `repository <https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/issues>`_.

If you have any questions regarding TEASER feel free to contact us at
`ebc-teaser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de <ebc-teaser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de>`_.

Note that this documentation will always be auto-generated using the
`development branch <https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/tree/development>`_.
That means, there might be new developments described in this docu that are not
working in the master and pip installation of TEASER. A list of those issue can
be found `here <development.html>`_

Also have a look at the `FAQ section <faq.html>`_. If you feel your question should also be listed, please open an issue in the issue section of the `repository <https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/issues>`_.
