logic
====================

The logic package holds python modules for the representation of general
building objects and archetypes. In addition the simulation package holds
modules to sort and calculate model syntax specific parameters for AixLib and
IBPSA (e.g. in AixLib we need to define orientations and tilts for the
whole building) The utility module helps us to do path handling.
