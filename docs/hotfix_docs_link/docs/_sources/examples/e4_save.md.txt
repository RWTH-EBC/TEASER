```python
"""This module contains an example how to save buildings from a TEASER
project to json and pickle in order to save information.
"""

import teaser.examples.e1_generate_archetype as e1
import teaser.logic.utilities as utilities
import os
```
 In e1_generate_archetype we created a Project with three archetype
 buildings to get this Project we rerun this example
```python
prj = e1.example_generate_archetype()
```
 First option is to use TEASERs own json format to save all relevant
 data into a more or less human readable format. The corresponding
 function is called Project().save_project() you can specify a file name
  and a save path. If both are non (as in this case) it will use the
 projects name and default path in your home folder.
```python
prj.save_project(file_name=None, path=None)
```
 Second option is to use pickle from Python Standard Library ,
 which will save the whole Python classes and all attributes into a
 binary file. There is no specific API function for this, but you can
 simply create an empty file with open() and then use pickle.dump().
 Make sure you specify your path correctly. In this case we want to use
 the default path of TEASERs output.
```python
import pickle

pickle_file = os.path.join(utilities.get_default_path(), "teaser_pickle.p")

pickle.dump(prj, open(pickle_file, "wb"))
```
