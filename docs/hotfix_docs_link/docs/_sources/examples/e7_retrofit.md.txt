"""This module contains an example that shows how to retrofit all buildings
in a TEASER project with different setups
"""

import teaser.examples.e1_generate_archetype as e1
```
 In e1_generate_archetype we created a Project with three archetype
 buildings to get this Project we rerun this example
```python
prj = e1.example_generate_archetype()
```
 To apply simplified retrofit for all buildings in the project we can
 use Project.retrofit_all_buildings() function. This will retrofit all
 building in the project in following manner:
 1. Replace all window with a new window (default is EnEv window with
 U-Value of XYZ
 2. Add an additional insulation layer to all outer walls (including,
 roof and ground floor). Set the thickness that it corresponds to the
 retrofit standard od the year of retrofit.
 The year of retrofit has to be specified. In addition, we can set
 the used window_type and the type of insulation material used.
 As we have both `iwu`/`bmvbs` and `tabuly` typology in our project we need
 to pass all keywords to the function year_of_retrofit, window_type,
 material for `iwu`/`bmvbs` and type_of_retrofit for `tabula`.
```python
prj.retrofit_all_buildings(
    year_of_retrofit=2015,
    type_of_retrofit="adv_retrofit",
    window_type='Alu- oder Stahlfenster, Isolierverglasung',
    material='EPS_perimeter_insulation_top_layer')
```
