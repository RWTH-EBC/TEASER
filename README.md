# TEASER - Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit

The TEASER tool allows the creation of archetpye as well as the representation of existing buildings and the calculation of simulation parameters for simulation models. 
It is being developed at the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) at RWTH Aachen University.

This site will be used to further develop the library and make it available under the MIT License.

If you have any questions regarding TEASER feel free to contact us at teaser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de.
