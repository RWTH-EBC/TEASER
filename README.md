TEASER (Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit) allows
fast generation of archetype buildings with low input requirements and the
export of individual dynamic simulation models for Modelica libraries [AixLib](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib) and
[Modelica IBPSA library](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica). It is being
developed at the [RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute
for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate](https://www.ebc.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/cms/~dmzz/E-ON-ERC-EBC/?lidx=1).

The full documentation of TEASER including examples and description of modules,
classes and functions can be found at the website:

## Description

Energy supply of buildings in urban context currently undergoes significant
changes. The increase of renewable energy sources for electrical and thermal
energy generation will require flexible and secure energy storage and
distribution systems. To reflect and consider these changes in energy systems
and buildings, dynamic simulation is one key element, in particular when it
comes to thermal energy demand on minutely or hourly scale.
Sparse and limited access to detailed building information as well as computing
times are challenges for building simulation on urban scale. In addition,
data acquisition and modeling for Building Performance Simulation (BPS) are
time consuming and error-prone. To enable the use of BPS on urban scale we
present the TEASER tool, an open framework for urban energy modeling of
building stocks. TEASER provides an easy interface for multiple data sources,
data enrichment (where necessary) and export of ready-to-run Modelica simulation
models for [AixLib](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib) and
[Modelica IBPSA library](https://github.com/ibpsa/modelica).


## Version

TEASER is a ongoing research project, the current version is 0.5.1, which is
still a pre-release.

## How to use TEASER

### Dependencies

TEASER uses Python 2.7 <= v >=3.3. Further using a Python distribution is
recommended as they already contain (or easily support installation of) many
Python packages (e.g. SciPy, NumPy, pip, PyQT, etc.) that are used in the
TEASER code. Two examples of those distributions are:

1. https://winpython.github.io/ WinPython comes along with a lot of Python
packages (e.g. SciPy, NumPy, pip, PyQT, etc.)..
2. http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html Conda is an open source package
management  system and environment management system for installing multiple
versions of software  packages and their dependencies and switching easily
between them.

In addition, TEASER requires some specific Python packages:

1. Mako: template Engine
  install on a python-enabled command line with `pip install -U mako`
2. PyXB: XML binding Engine
  install on a python-enabled command line with `pip install -U pyxb`
3. pytest: Unit Tests engine
  install on a python-enabled command line with `pip install -U pytest`

### Installation

The best option to install TEASER is to use pip:

`pip install teaser`

If you actively develop TEASER you can clone this repository by using:

 `git clone [SSH-Key/Https]`

and then run:

 `pip install -e [Path/to/your/Teaser/Clone]` which will install the local version of TEASER.
