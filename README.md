# TEASER4 - Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit

The TEASER4 tool allows the creation of archetpye as well as the representation of existing buildings and the calculation of simulation parameters for simulation models. 
It is being developed at the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) at RWTH Aachen University.

This site will be used to further develop the library and make it available under the MIT License.

If you have any questions regarding TEASER4 feel free to contact us at teaser@eonerc.rwth-aachen.de.

### License

TEASER4 is released by RWTH Aachen University's Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

### Acknowledgements

Parts of TEASER4 have been developed within public funded projects and with financial support by BMWi (German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy).

### Description

TEASER4 contains an archetype building generator as well as parameter calculation for the Low Order Model of [AixLib](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib). TEASER4 will be able to interface arbitrary data sources.

### Version

The current version is 0.1.3. As the idea of TEASER came up at the Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate (EBC) at RWTH Aachen University in 2012 we leave the number 4 as a reminder.
