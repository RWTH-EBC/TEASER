# TEASER - Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit

The TEASER (Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit) tool
allows the creation of archetype buildings as well as the
representation of existing buildings and the calculation of simulation
parameters for reduced oder models. It is being developed at the RWTH Aachen University, E.ON Energy Research Center, Institute for Energy Efficient Buildings and Indoor Climate.

The full documentation of TEASER including examples and description of modules,
classes and functions can be found [here](http://pythonhosted.org/teaser/).

This GitHub page will be used to further develop the library and make it
available under the
[MIT License](https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/blob/master/License.md).

### Description

Energy supply of buildings in urban context currently undergoes significant
changes. The increase of renewable energy sources for electrical and thermal
energy generation will require flexible and secure energy storage and
distribution systems. To reflect and consider these changes in energy systems
and buildings, dynamic simulation is one key element, in particular when it
comes to thermal energy demand on minutely or hourly scale.
Sparse and limited access to detailed building information as well as computing
times are challenges for building simulation on urban scale. In addition,
data acquisition and modelling for Building Performance Simulation (BPS) are
time consuming and error-prone. To enable the use of BPS on urban scale we
present the TEASER tool, an open framework for urban energy modelling of
building stocks. TEASER provides an easy interface for multiple data sources,
data enrichment, where necessary and export of ready-to-run Modelica simulation
models for [AixLib] (https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib) and
IEA-EBC [Annex60](https://github.com/iea-annex60/modelica-annex60).

### Version

The current version is 0.3.9, which is a pre-release.

### How to cite TEASER

A Journal Paper presenting TEASER is already submitted and is in review.
