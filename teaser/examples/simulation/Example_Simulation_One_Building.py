'''
This script demonstrates a automated creation of a office typebuilding and its
simulation with dymola and the AixLib controlled by the python package
buildingspy

General Requirements:
- Buildingspy (pypi version not recommendend / use github version instead)
- Dymola (with dymola.exe set to your environment variable PATH)
- AixLib (the actual master from the github repository)
- installed version of TEASER (sure you have this, your using it, but if not
                               sure checkout the github documentation!)

Python 2.7:
you can use the buildingspy package which is available over pypip, but the
actual versions are only available on github (links below)
After installation (read the docu of buildingspy!) This script should be self
describing

Python 3:
you need to install a port to python 3 from the buildingspy package. you can do
it on your own or use the ported package (links below / Only simulator package
is ported)
If its installed correctly you should be able to use this script.

Buildingspy 2.7: https://github.com/lbl-srg/BuildingsPy
Buildingspy 3.0: https://github.com/MichaMans/BuildingsPy/tree/python3
