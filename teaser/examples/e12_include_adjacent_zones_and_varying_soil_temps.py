This script demonstrates five features of TEASER:
 - how borders between adjacent zones can be modelled
 - in connection to that, the export to a FiveElement AixLib ROM model
 - how elements (here windows) can be newer than the building and get the
   respective typical properties
 - how non-constant soil temperatures are included
 - how custom templates for the Modelica export are used
 - the different estimation approaches for the interior wall area
