# # Example 7: Generate single building
# This module contains an example that shows to create a building not using
# the archetype approach but adding all information separately. In this example
# we import all needed modules and classes where we need it in the code. For you
# application we suggest to use PEP008 and import them at the beginning of the
# script.
# You can run this example using the [jupyter-notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/master?labpath=docs%2Fjupyter_notebooks)

    # First step: Import the TEASER API (called Project) into your Python module

    from teaser.project import Project

    # To use the API instantiate the Project class and rename the Project. The
    # parameter load_data=True indicates that we load data into our
    # Project (e.g. for Material properties and typical wall constructions.
    # This can take a few seconds, depending on the size of the used data base.

    prj = Project(load_data=True)

    # Instantiate a Building class and set the Project API as a parent to
    # this building. This will automatically add this building and all its
    # future changes to the project. This is helpful as we can use the data
    # base and API functions (like explained in e2 - e5). We also set some
    # building parameters. Be careful: Dymola does not like whitespaces in
    # names and filenames, thus we will delete them anyway in TEASER.
