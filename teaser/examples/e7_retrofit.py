# # Example 7: Retrofit buildings
# This module contains an example that shows how to retrofit all buildings
# in a TEASER project with different setups
# You can run this example using the [jupyter-notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/RWTH-EBC/TEASER/master?labpath=docs%2Fjupyter_notebooks)

import teaser.examples.e1_generate_archetype as e1


def example_retrofit_building():
    """This function demonstrates retrofit options of TEASER API"""

    # In e1_generate_archetype we created a Project with three archetype
    # buildings to get this Project we rerun this example

    prj = e1.example_generate_archetype()

    # To apply simplified retrofit for all buildings in the project we can
    # use Project.retrofit_all_buildings() function. This will retrofit all
    # building in the project in following manner:
    # 1. Replace all window with a new window (default is EnEv window with
    # U-Value of XYZ
    # 2. Add an additional insulation layer to all outer walls (including,
    # roof and ground floor). Set the thickness that it corresponds to the
    # retrofit standard od the year of retrofit.
    # The year of retrofit has to be specified. In addition, we can set
    # the used window_type and the type of insulation material used.
    # As we have both `iwu`/`bmvbs` and `tabuly` typology in our project we need
    # to pass all keywords to the function year_of_retrofit, window_type,
    # material for `iwu`/`bmvbs` and type_of_retrofit for `tabula`.
