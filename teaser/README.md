# TEASER - Tool for Energy Analysis and Simulation for Efficient Retrofit
=========================================================================
This software is work-in-progress. Documentation will be incomplete or missing 
and the software may not run properly.

General Purpose
---------------
TEASER is a tool for the generation of archetype buildings and parameter 
calculation of Modelica building models.

Installation
-------------------------
The best option to install TEASER is to clone the repository by using::

 `git clone [SSH-Key/Https]`

and then run::

 `pip install -e [Path/to/your/Teaser/Clone]`

You need to have pip installed (see dependencies).

Deinstallation
-------------------------
The best option is not to uninstall TEASER at all:-). However, if you want to
uninstall it, just use::

 `pip uninstall teaser`

Dependencies
------------
TEASER uses Python 2.7 <= v >=3.3. Further using a WinPython distribution is
recommended (https://winpython.github.io/). WinPython comes along with a lot of
Python packages (e.g. SciPy, NumPy, pip, PyQT, etc.) that are used in the
TEASER code.

In addition, TEASER requires some specific Python packages:

1. Mako: template Engine
   install on a python-enabled command line with `pip install -U mako`
2. PyXB: XML binding Engine
   install on a python-enabled command line with `pip install -U pyxb`
3. pytest: Unit Tests engine
   install on a python-enabled command line with `pip install -U pytest`



Contents
--------
The source folder contains different elements. After installation these elements
are stored in different places depending on your system.

### Package: data
This package contains interfaces to different data sources, XML data bases,  
as well as PyXB Data Bindings for XML based data.

### Package: examples
This package contains some examples how to use TEASER in a script based manner,
 as well as some verification of the calculation core


### Package: logic
This package contains all classes of the internal data model of TEASER, 
as well as the archetype buildings and parameter calculation.

### Package: gui

This package contains classes and modules needed for the graphical user 
interface.

Future Developments
--------

- extended CityGML support
- enhance GUI
