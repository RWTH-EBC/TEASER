    '''Use conditions saver.

    Saves use conditions according to their usage type in the the XML file
    for use conditions in InputData. If the Project parent is set, it
    automatically saves it to the file given in Project.data. Alternatively
    you can specify a path to a file of UseConditions. If this
    file does not exist, a new file is created.
