class OuterWall(Wall):
    """OuterWall class

    This class holds information of an outer wall and is a child of Wall()

    Parameters
    ----------

    parent : ThermalZone()
        The parent class of this object, the ThermalZone the BE belongs to.
        Allows for better control of hierarchical structures. If not None it
        adds this OuterWall to ThermalZone.outer_walls.
        Default is None.

    Attributes
    ----------

    internal_id : float
        Random id for the distinction between different elements.
    name : str
        Individual name
    construction_type : str
        Type of construction (e.g. "heavy" or "light"). Needed for
        distinction between different constructions types in the same
        building age period.
    year_of_retrofit : int
        Year of last retrofit
    year_of_construction : int
        Year of first construction
    building_age_group : list
        Determines the building age period that this building
        element belongs to [begin, end], e.g. [1984, 1994]
    area : float [m2]
        Area of building element
    tilt : float [degree]
        Tilt against horizontal, default is 90.0
    orientation : float [degree]
        Azimuth direction of building element (0 : north, 90: east, 180: south,
        270: west)
    inner_convection : float [W/(m2*K)]
        Constant heat transfer coefficient of convection inner side (facing
        the zone), default 2.7
    inner_radiation : float [W/(m2*K)]
        Constant heat transfer coefficient of radiation inner side (facing
        the zone), default 5.0
    outer_convection : float [W/(m2*K)]
        Constant heat transfer coefficient of convection outer side (facing
        the ambient or adjacent zone), default 20.0
    outer_radiation : float [W/(m2*K)]
        Constant heat transfer coefficient of radiation outer side (facing
        the ambient or adjacent zone), default 5.0
    layer : list
        List of all layers of a building element (to be filled with Layer
        objects). Use element.layer = None to delete all layers of the building
        element
