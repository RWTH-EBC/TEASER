class EST1a(Residential):
    """Archetype for Urban Fabric Type EST1a.

    Subclass from Residential for urban fabric type EST1a. Boundary values
    for this archetype are taken from :cite:`Hegger.2014`. The archetype
    calculation
    is adapted from :cite:`KurzverfahrenIWU`, with the change of using the
    facade area to volume ratio of the building. For further information see
    :cite:`Lauster.2016`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    parent: Project()
        The parent class of this object, the Project the Building belongs
        to. Allows for better control of hierarchical structures. If not None it
        adds this Building instance to Project.buildings.
    name : str
        Individual name
    height_of_floors : float [m]
        Average height of the buildings' floors
    number_of_floors : int
        Number of building's floors above ground
    year_of_construction : int
        Year of first construction
    net_leased_area : float [m2]
        Total net leased area of building. This is area is NOT the footprint
        of a building
    with_ahu : Boolean
        If set to True, an empty instance of BuildingAHU is instantiated and
        assigned to attribute central_ahu. This instance holds information for
        central Air Handling units. Default is False.
    internal_gains_mode: int [1, 2, 3]
        mode for the internal gains calculation by persons:
        1: Temperature and activity degree dependent calculation. The
           calculation is based on  SIA 2024 (default)
        2: Temperature and activity degree independent calculation, the max.
           heatflowrate is prescribed by the parameter
           fixed_heat_flow_rate_persons.
        3: Temperature and activity degree dependent calculation with
           consideration of moisture. The calculation is based on SIA 2024
    neighbour_buildings : int
        Number of neighbour buildings. CAUTION: this will not change
        the orientation of the buildings wall, but just the overall
        exterior wall and window area(!) (default = 0)
            0: no neighbour
            1: one neighbour
            2: two neighbours
    construction_type : str
        Construction type of used wall constructions default is "heavy")
            heavy: heavy construction
            light: light construction

    Note
    ----------
    The listed attributes are just the ones that are set by the user
    calculated values are not included in this list. Changing these values is
    expert mode.

    Attributes
    ----------

        (str). (Default see doc string above)
    outer_wall_names : dict
        This dictionary contains a random name for the outer walls,
        their orientation and tilt. Default is a building in north-south
        orientation)

        This dictionary contains the name of the roofs, their orientation
        and tilt. Default is one flat roof.

        This dictionary contains the name of the window, their
        orientation and tilt. Default is a building in north-south
        orientation)
    inner_wall_names : dict
        This dictionary contains the name of the inner walls, their
        orientation and tilt. Default is one cumulated inner wall.
    ceiling_names : dict
        This dictionary contains the name of the ceilings, their
        orientation and tilt. Default is one cumulated ceiling.
    floor_names : dict
        This dictionary contains the name of the floors, their
        orientation and tilt. Default is one cumulated floor.
