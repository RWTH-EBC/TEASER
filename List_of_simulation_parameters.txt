Short description:
left side parameters which are in the zoneBase Record or the buildingBase record, used in Model means
if this parameters are really used in the model by instantiation of classes with this parameters.

middle column means if this parameter is in the export. no is selfexplaining, hardcoded means for now,
that this parameter is set to a specific value, full means a fully integration in TEASER.

right column give an example where to find the paramters in TEASER, the addition "only instantiation" 
means that this parameter is not yet fully integrated and is only instantiate with a given value at
the given location
